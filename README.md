# KE5107_LeagueofLegends
Repository to contain all the R scripts that we develop for the KE5107 course CA assessment on the League of Legends dataset 


## Description of files

1. LeagueofLegends Discovery.Rmd - contains all scripts to perform discovery on the raw dataset
2. Process.Rmd - contains all scripts to perform data processing and create more columns from the existing ones. This generates a processed file as output.
3. Processed Data Discovery.Rmd - Contains all scripts to do additional discovery on the processed data. Note that this should use the processed file as input.

4. You can have a look at 'anurag' branch to get an idea of what should be present in your branch
